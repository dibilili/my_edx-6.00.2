### Problem 2: R^2
#10.0/10.0 points (graded)  
#After we create some regression models, we also want to be able to evaluate our models to figure out how well
# each model represents our data, and tell good models from poorly fitting ones. One way to evaluate how well 
# the model describes the data is computing the model's R^2 value. R^2 provides a measure of how well the total variation of samples is explained by the model.

#Implement the function <code>r_squared</code>. This function will take in:

#- list, <code>y</code>, that represents the y-coordinates of the original data samples
#- estimated, which is a corresponding list of y-coordinates estimated from the regression model

#This function should return the computed R^2 value. You can compute R^2 as follows, where <math>e_i</math> 
# is the estimated y value for the i-th data point (i.e. predicted by the regression), $y_i$ is the y value 
# for the ith data point, and $mean$ is the mean of the original data samples.

#If you are still confused about R^2 , its [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination)
# page has a good explanation about its use/how to calculate it.

#Note: If you want to use numpy arrays, you should <code>import numpy as np</code> and use <code>np.METHOD_NAME</code> 
# in your code. Unfortunately, <code>pylab</code> does not work with the grader.#

#```python
import numpy as np

def r_squared(y, estimated):
    """
    Calculate the R-squared error term.
    Args:
        y: list with length N, representing the y-coords of N sample points
        estimated: a list of values estimated by the regression model
    Returns:
        a float for the R-squared error term
    """
    # TODO
    y, estimated = np.array(y), np.array(estimated)
    SEE = ((estimated - y)**2).sum()
    mMean = y.sum()/float(len(y))
    MV = ((mMean - y)**2).sum()
    return 1 - SEE/MV
```

correct
